# ABC Hotel's holiday planner

## Aim
In this project I built a holiday planner in ABC hotel's website ,where customers can view the current week's deals and calculate the total cost for each package. The flight, hotel and car rental costs can be calculated based on each customer's need. The custmoer can confirm the booking if they find the the total holiday cost appealing.

## Objective
This project was done to practise and further understand the use of functions in python programming.
